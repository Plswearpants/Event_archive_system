# Event_archive_system

## Overview

The Event Archive System is designed to be the ultimate archive for recording various instances of events in an individual's life. Utilizing advanced LLM (Language Model) assistance and multimodal inputs (text, audio, video, images), this system aims to standardize and streamline the documentation process for different types of projects and events. This repository includes subprojects that cater to various user scenarios such as archiving working projects, moderating life goals, managing personal business projects, and more.

## Features

- **Multimodal Input Support:** Accepts and processes text, audio, video, and image inputs.
- **LLM Assistance:** Uses GPT-4o for generating structured and standardized notes and records.
- **Standardized Format:** Ensures consistency and clarity across all recorded events and projects.
- **Versatile Use Cases:** Suitable for documenting laboratory experiments, personal business projects, life goals, and other significant events.
- **Searchable Archives:** Creates easily searchable records with unique indexing and metadata tagging.

## Subprojects

### 1. Laboratory Notes Management

This subproject demonstrates the system's capability to manage and archive laboratory studies and experiments. It converts multimodal inputs into detailed and structured lab notes, ensuring accuracy and reproducibility.

#### Features

- **Pre-Experiment Planning:** Guides users in planning and structuring their experiments.
- **Real-Time Data Recording:** Allows for accurate and real-time recording of observations and data during experiments.
- **Post-Experiment Reflection:** Facilitates reflection and analysis after the experiment is completed.
- **Reproducibility:** Provides comprehensive details for others to replicate the experiment without gaps.
- **Searchable Notes:** Includes metadata and unique indexing for easy search and retrieval.
